## 🎓 About This Project

As a **Computer Science undergraduate**, I created this project to learn:
- GUI development with Tkinter
- Real-time data updating using `.after()`
- Working with Python's built-in `datetime` module
- Organizing layouts with `Label` and `.place()`

This is one of my early GUI projects and serves as a foundational step toward more advanced desktop applications.
